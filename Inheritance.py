"""Inheritance"""

"""Inheritance consists of creating a subclass from an existing class. 
We say that this new class inherits from the first because it will automatically 
have the same attributes and methods."""

"""We can define a Motorcycle class that inherits from the Vehicle class (from classes.py) in the following way:"""

# and we can use the method to change the color from class vehicle
